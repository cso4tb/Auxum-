											<h3>Tutoring Customized for You</h3>
											<hr>
											<p>At  Auxum, we know that every student is unique. That's why we have created a tutoring platform that is customized to fit each student. Our students take an online assesment and enter the test date they are preparing for along with the time they plan to prepare each day, and our algorithm will  create a tutoring plan tailored just for you. Auxum's resources are developed specifically for each student: all our content- from the topics, pace, and difficulty level- is tailored to each student. Through preparation on your schedule, Auxum boosts your weaknesses, refreshes your knowledge to ensure you do not forget what you have learned, and keeps you on track to be successful on your AP exam. </p>

									<!--		<p>We are three undergraduates at the University of Virginia with shared passions for computer science and helping students reach their full potential. The concept of Auxum sprung from our realization that studying for the AP exam is typically far harder than it needs to be. As the information needed to be successful on the exam is standardized, algorithms could be implmented to quickly asses a students strengths and weaknesses in these subject areas to create a study plan customized for the student. With an understanding of an AP student's needs (we all have taken our fair share of AP exams) and the technical skills necessary to develop such a program, we created  Auxum test prep. </p>  -->
