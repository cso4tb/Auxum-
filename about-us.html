												<h2>About Us</h2>
												<p>A service for students created by students.</p>
											</header>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/aboutus.jpg" alt="" /></span>

											<p>We are three undergraduates at the University of Virginia with shared passions for computer science and helping students reach their full potential. The concept of Auxum sprung from our realization that studying for the AP exam is typically far harder than it needs to be. As the information needed to be successful on the exam is standardized, algorithms could be implmented to quickly asses a students strengths and weaknesses in these subject areas to create a study plan customized for the student. With an understanding of an AP student's needs (we all have taken our fair share of AP exams) and the technical skills necessary to develop such a program, we created  Auxum test prep. </p>
